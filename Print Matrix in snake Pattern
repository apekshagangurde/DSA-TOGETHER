\hspace*{0.5 in}In this work, RFID (Radio Frequency
Identification Device) labels are used to create electronic
transportation tickets for the public transportation system.
Transport systems with cutting-edge innovations like RFID, IoT,
and GPS will eventually gain popularity due to their advantages
of greater comfort and higher ethical standards as compared to
traditional transport systems or paper ticketing systems. In the
proposed approach, the passenger is automatically identified by
using their RFID card, and the fare according to the distance
travelled by the passenger is automatically subtracted from the
RFID card. GPS and RFID tags are used to increase the
precision of fare calculation and passenger identification. The
RFID system can replace conventional paper-based tickets since
they are better because they are reusable and offer improved
accuracy. This eliminates the outdated paper-based bus booking
system and guards against money laundering and corruption.
RFID tags are used as reusable tickets that calculate the fee
based on the user's GPS-measured distance travelled. By using
this system, human errors and effort are reduced.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
\hspace{0.5 in}Smart Metropolises need better transport services. A
region's growth development is accelerated by the effective
movement of people, goods, and services. Any society must
have a well-organized and managed transportation network. The transportation network of a megacity is essential to its
effective operation. For those who live in metropolitan
regions, life comes to a complete stop when there are no
effective commute options. In contemporary high-tech
metropolises, a good transportation system and channel
operation establish a high standard of living. A megacity’s
transportation system is pivotal to its effective operation.
When there are no practical commute options, life for
individuals who live in civic areas fully stops. A good
transportation structure and channel operation produce a high
position of living in Ultramodern high-tech metropolises.
According to request reports, the smart transportation member
will experience periodic growth of 25.1 during the coming
five times. By 2021, it's anticipated to grow from USD 72.05
billion in 2016 to USD 220.76 billion. In smart
metropolises, the need for public security and safety, and
government measures to upgrade the current transportation
Structure are the main motorists of this growth. The purpose
of the service is to encourage individuals to take public
transportation. It helps to guarantee the safety of those using
public transportation. The integration of the transportation
system saves guests time by barring the need to buy tickets for
colourful types of transportation. They can admit one chow
card and make a single electronic payment for motorcars,
metros, trains, and other transportation. The card can be
reloaded online, offline, or at retail locales or conveyance
capitals. Systems for s mart transportation and
multitudinous wireless communication results have been
suggested. Within ITS, radio modem communication is
constantly employed for both short- and long-range
communication on UHF and VHF frequencies. There's a trend
toward smaller, more important computer processors on auto
as a result of recent advancements in automotive electronics.
Beginning in the early 2000s, the current trends involve
smaller, more expensive CPU modules that operate on tackle
memory and real-time operating systems. Artificial
intelligence, ubiquitous computing, and model-grounded
process control are just a few of the more sophisticated software activities that may be imposed on the newly
established system platforms. In vehicle satellite
navigation and GPS (global positioning system) systems with
two-way communication with a commercial data source are
being installed in an increasing number of vehicles. To
calculate vehicle pets, these vehicles' position measures are
used. ultramodern ways might rather calculate on smartphonegrounded results employing so called Telematics 2.0 ways
rather than technical tackle. For these new mobility models to
be successful, mate operation chops and high monetization
dexterity are needed. Earnings can be divided fleetly and
fluently using customizable agreements and billing platforms,
which also improves customer satisfaction. druggies can admit
advanced service as well as abatements, fidelity points, and
Impulses, as well as be laboriously engaged through direct
marketing.
The service's goal is to promote the usage of public
transportation by individuals. By effectively automating,
planning, and managing public transportation with the use of
real-time data analysis of various routes, the goal can be
accomplished. The data aids in understanding vehicle
schedules and provides operators and dispatchers with quick
responses during deviation, delay, or other emergency events.
Additionally, it aids in maintaining the safety of passengers
using public transportation.
The technologies utilised in intelligent transportation
systems range from basic management systems such as GPS
enabled cars, traffic signal control systems, or speed cameras
to monitoring applications such as security CCTV systems
and automatic incident detection or halted vehicle detection
systems. In our country, there are frequent problems with
the buses that are related to the ticketing procedure. The bus
conductor will hand out tickets to every passenger. According
to the headcount and the amount given, the conductor should
allocate the ticket to the passengers. It will take a lot of
additional paper to print the tickets, and using a portable
machine also creates a lot of problems. The traveller also
needs to bring the right amount of money. The conductor
ought to have the appropriate change when a traveller doesn't
have the required sum. Sometimes conductors don't give
passengers the correct change. For example, a ticket
from Salem to Coimbatore costs just 49 rupees, but really the
traveller on that bus instead gives the conductor 50 rupees.
After then, the driver must give the passenger one rupee.
Many conductors fail to give passengers the correct change,
however, some do. RFID is used in modern technologies to
overcome these problems. The RFID reader will extract
information about the passenger from the RFID tag. The
relevant sum is deducted from the passenger using the RFID
tag. To resolve this issue of the paper ticketing system for
passengers who travel regularly many works come into
consideration like tracking the distance of the passengers as
well as the RFID-based authentications which will act as a
pass for the vehicle and soon.
\\
\section{Proposed system}

\hspace{0.5 in}This work calls for computerized ticketing for the public
transit system. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Device)
labels will be present. Transportation systems equipped with
modern innovations like RFID, IoT, and GPS will eventually
become more popular due to their advantages over
conventional transport methods, such as improved comfort
and higher living standards. The suggested architecture calls
for automatic passenger identification and automatic charge
deduction based on distance travelled. To improve the
accuracy of fee calculation and passenger identification, RFID
tags and GPS are employed. The RFID system can replace
conventional paper-based tickets since it is more accurate and
superior because it allows for multiple uses. By doing this,
cheating and financial fraud are avoided as well as the
outdated paper-based car ticketing system. Reusable tickets
made of RFID tags use GPS technology to calculate the cost
based on the distance the user travels. Human mistakes and
efforts are reduced with this method. This system gives
the passenger very accurate results upon their travel and made
them feel free to travel in a public transport system. The
system automatically tracks and calculates the passenger’s
travel distance, and it additionally shows the base price. \\
\section{Objectives}
\hspace*{0.5 in}\textbf{\textit{Designing a model of a travel system for passengers while
they are traveling.}}
This work represents a comprehensive and highly automated ticketing system that offers unparalleled convenience, particularly for passengers who are frequent travelers. At its core, this system introduces smart cards, a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to the traditional paper-based ticketing system. These smart cards are not only reusable but also highly practical, serving as universal travel cards that grant passengers access to any route within the transportation network.

What sets this system apart is its integration of Internet and GPS services, leveraging both to provide a seamless and efficient experience for passengers. Internet connectivity is harnessed for real-time fare calculation and to access a range of travel-related information. The inclusion of GPS technology ensures accurate measurement of the distance a passenger has traveled. Importantly, GPS operates independently of Internet connectivity, making it a robust and reliable component of the system. Even in areas with limited or no Internet access, passengers can trust the GPS functionality to provide accurate location and distance data. In essence, this integrated system not only simplifies ticketing but also enhances the overall travel experience, all while promoting sustainability and reliability in the transportation sector.\\
\hspace*{0.5 in}
\textbf{\textit{Design an application in which passengers can track the
distance and the amount for it.}}
 This innovative transportation system has been meticulously designed to offer passengers the utmost clarity and convenience, particularly when making fare payments using smart cards. The system is engineered to ensure that passengers can seamlessly and effortlessly deduct the precise fare amount from their smart cards, eliminating any room for confusion or discrepancy.

Central to the system's operation is the integration of a Universal Serial Bus (USB) MODEM, a sophisticated component that serves as a pivotal link. This USB MODEM is instrumental in the creation and online access to a comprehensive traveler's database, enhancing the efficiency and transparency of the entire ticketing and travel process. It empowers the system to swiftly and accurately process and verify transactions, all while providing a real-time database for monitoring passenger journeys and transactions.

Moreover, the system employs a highly advanced computer algorithm with the capability to disseminate real-time position data over the internet. This real-time tracking and monitoring mechanism transform the transportation system into an Internet of Things (IoT)-based infrastructure. This IoT integration not only enhances the operational efficiency but also enriches the passenger experience by providing real-time information about routes, journey times, and any service-related updates.

Beyond its application in general passenger transport, this progressive approach is also being extended to bolster the safety and reliability of other transportation sectors. For instance, it is being harnessed to ensure the secure and punctual transit of schoolchildren, where accuracy and dependability are paramount.

The ultimate goal of this visionary initiative is to provide travelers with the most dependable Prepaid Smart Card solution available. These smart cards offer passengers a secure and user-friendly means of accessing transportation services while significantly reducing the reliance on traditional paper-based ticketing systems. By harnessing modern technology, data-driven solutions, and IoT principles, this system seeks to redefine the travel experience, making it both convenient and reliable for passengers, while also promoting sustainability and transparency in the transportation sector.\\

\chapter{Problem Definition}

\section{Problem Definition}
\hspace*{0.5 in}The traditional ticketing system have many flaws some of which are mentioned below\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Ticketing Systems:} Many legacy public transportation systems still rely on manual, paper-based ticketing processes. These systems are often time-consuming and error-prone. Passengers may need exact change, and conductors or ticketing staff can make mistakes in providing tickets and change. This inefficiency can lead to delays and inconvenience.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Real-Time Information:} Traditional ticketing systems often do not provide passengers with real-time information about their travel history, distances traveled, and fare details. This lack of transparency can make it difficult for passengers to plan their journeys effectively and can lead to operational challenges for transportation authorities.
    \item \textbf{Environmental Impact:} Paper-based ticketing systems generate a significant amount of paper waste. This environmental impact is a growing concern as more focus is placed on sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint of transportation systems. Shifting toward more eco-friendly solutions is a critical consideration.
    \item \textbf{Security Concerns:} Traditional ticketing systems may be vulnerable to security issues such as money laundering, corruption, and fraud. The lack of a robust method for tracking passenger journeys and fare calculations can create opportunities for illicit activities. Enhancing security and transparency in public transportation operations is essential [IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK].
    \item \textbf{Operational Inefficiencies:} Conventional transportation systems may suffer from operational inefficiencies, including underutilization of the fleet. Without real-time data and tracking, it can be challenging to optimize routes, schedules, and resources efficiently. This can lead to increased operational costs and reduced service quality [8].
    \item \textbf{Manual Data Handling:} Legacy systems often involve manual data handling for various tasks, such as record-keeping and fare collection. This manual approach is not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors and data inaccuracies [IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK].
    \item \textbf{Limited Payment Options: }Traditional systems often have limited payment options, which can be inconvenient for passengers who prefer electronic payment methods. Offering a variety of payment options and enhancing the overall payment experience can attract more passengers to public transportation [18].
\end{itemize}

In summary, these problems highlight the need for innovative solutions in public transportation systems. The "IoT-based Web Application for Passenger Travel Tracking System" is designed to address these challenges by introducing an integrated approach that leverages IoT and RFID technology to offer electronic ticketing, automatic passenger identification, real-time tracking, and more, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and passenger experience of public transportation networks.







\section{Solution}
The "IoT-based Web Application for Passenger Travel Tracking System" offers significant advantages over traditional ticketing systems in public transportation. It enhances efficiency by providing real-time tracking, allowing passengers to monitor their location and fare through a user-friendly web app. This system offers convenience with digital payments, reducing the need for cash or tokens. Furthermore, it reduces the environmental impact by eliminating paper-based tickets and aligns with sustainability goals. Enhanced security features minimize fraud and money laundering risks, and operational optimization data improves resource allocation. Passengers enjoy reduced queues and accurate fare calculations, leading to an improved travel experience. Data-driven decision-making is facilitated, and its IoT integration adds flexibility and adaptability across different transportation modes. This system contributes to smart cities' development and offers valuable insights into passenger behavior and preferences, ultimately fostering more efficient, sustainable, and technology-driven urban transportation networks.\\

    \caption{Block diagram}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\hspace*{0.5 in}The block diagram for the IoT-based Passenger Travel Tracking System consists of two primary phases: the Physical Layer and the Application Layer. These two layers work in tandem to enable real-time tracking and monitoring of passenger journeys.\\
The block diagram consists of two phases one is the
physical layer which is nothing but a hardware representation
layer and the other one is an application layer. The physical
layer consists of all the hardware parts like MSP430g2553
Microcontroller, NODEMCU WIFI module OLED Display,
RFID Reader, and RFID Card, GPS Module. All the hardware
parts are connected to each other. In this layer RFID Reader,
nothing but a smart card reader is connected to a WIFI
Module whenever the RFID Reader reads the smart it got
connected to the WIFI module, Microcontroller grasps the
information of the smart card and sent it to the web
application which is an application layer. The Application
layer consists of a web application that can provide us with
the necessary information regarding the travel history of a
passenger like distance, locations of the journey, time, date,
and base fare price of the passenger he has travelled.
Passengers can track their journeys using the web application\\
\hspace*{0.5in}



 {When a passenger or commuter boards a vehicle, the process begins by initiating a connection with the WIFI Module through a login. Subsequently, they are required to scan their RFID Card on the RFID reader. If the RFID reader successfully authenticates the card, the credentials are verified, and the passenger is granted access to the vehicle.

As the passenger boards the vehicle and scans their card, the system records the precise location of the passenger. This location information is instantly displayed on the OLED panel within the vehicle. Furthermore, when the passenger exits the vehicle, they are prompted to re-scan their card. This action serves to record the exit location of the passenger.

At this point, the system calculates the travel distance, as well as the fare price for the distance traveled. These details are promptly displayed on the OLED panel within the vehicle. Simultaneously, the system transmits all journey-related information, including distance, time, date, and fare price, to the web application via the Wi-Fi module ESP8266. This allows passengers to conveniently track and monitor their entire journey through the web application.}
